# 🧠 AI Empire Landing Page

This is a static landing page built with HTML and Tailwind CSS to showcase all the GPTs, Chrome extensions, services, and AI projects by [Your Name].

## 🚀 Live Demo
Host it on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for instant deployment.

## 📁 File Structure

```
ai-empire/
├── index.html
├── favicon.ico (optional)
```

## 📦 Setup & Deployment

### 1. Upload to GitHub
- Create a new GitHub repo (e.g., `ai-empire`)
- Upload the `index.html` file (and optionally `favicon.ico`)

### 2. Deploy to Vercel
- Visit [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
- Connect your GitHub account
- Import your repo
- Vercel auto-detects it as a static project
- Click **Deploy**

## ⚠️ Notes
- You're using Tailwind CDN. It’s fine for showcasing, but for production-grade speed, convert to a PostCSS or Tailwind CLI build.
- The favicon warning in console is harmless unless you're trying to load one. Just add a small `favicon.ico` or delete that line from `index.html`.
